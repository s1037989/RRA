#Authentication and Authorization
#A static html page that calls Ajax which requires authen/authz but fail result in those Ajax calls being 404.  Need JS handling of the 404s -- redirect to login page.
#Logins happen by presence of authen_username and authen_password parameters.
#Logouts happen by presence of authen_logout parameter.
#Login/Logout runmodes are necessary for generating the HTML, NOT for actually performing the login/logout.
#How to redirect an anonymous user on any page nicely to a login page?
#Redirect to login.html on logout

RequireAjax
Rather than croak, make the runmode 404

#RequireSSL
#Doesn't play well with AutoRunmode (I guess?), copy the code from RequireAjax (copied from AutoRunmode (I think?))
#Need to get SSL on rra.
#RequireSSL on login page only: That is the login form needs to POST to SSL (So really, RequireSSL isn't needed anywhere)
